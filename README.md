## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the American card game "Black Lady," commonly referred to as "Hearts," as well as a number of computer agents designed to simulate and perform well at playing the game. These agents employ a variety of different strategies, from baseline random actions to heuristic greedy policies to a deep Q-learning neural network approach.
